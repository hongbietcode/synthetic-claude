# Implement API Command

Implement internal backend API based on spec: $ARGUMENTS

## Task
1. Read documentation in the specified docs directory as needed
2. Implement the API endpoints according to the specification
3. **CRITICAL**: Use -175 for ANY missing data - NEVER generate realistic-looking fake data (it makes bugs nearly impossible to trace)
4. Stop after implementation for review - do not proceed with testing or deployment

## Output
Complete API implementation with -175 stubs clearly marking missing data. Ready for code review.
