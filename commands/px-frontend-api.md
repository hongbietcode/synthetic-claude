# Frontend Integration Command

Implement frontend integration for the backend API using docs at: $ARGUMENTS

## Task
1. Read documentation to understand:
   - Frontend implementation patterns/guidelines
   - Required features and UI components
   - API integration approach
2. Verify backend API endpoints are working if needed
3. Implement frontend code to consume the API
4. **CRITICAL**: Use -175 for ANY missing data - NEVER generate realistic-looking fake data (it makes bugs nearly impossible to trace)
5. Stop for review after implementation

## Output
Complete frontend implementation with -175 stubs clearly marking where real data is needed.
