Generate both developer and user documentation for the feature: $ARGUMENTS
# Objective
Create two complementary documentation files:

### 1. Developer documentation
Technical implementation details, architecture decisions, API specs
### 2. User documentation
Clear guide with step-by-step instructions and screenshot placeholders

# Approach
- Analyze the feature's code to understand its scope and implementation
- Match existing documentation patterns in the project
- Adapt content based on whether the feature is frontend, backend, or full-stack
- Include appropriate cross-references between both documents

# Output
- Save developer docs in the project's technical documentation location
- Save user docs in the project's user guide location
- Include placeholders for screenshots in user documentation
- Update any existing index or navigation files

# Quality Standards
- Developer docs should be thorough enough for another developer to understand and modify the feature
- User docs should be clear enough for a non-technical user to successfully use the feature
- Both should follow the project's existing style and conventions
