# Design Discussion Command

Analyze and discuss design improvements for $FILES without modifying any code.
My concern: $CONCERNS

## Process

### 1. Understanding Phase
- Read and analyze the structure, patterns, and relationships in $FILES
- Identify current design approach and architectural decisions
- Note any specific $CONCERNS mentioned in the request

### 2. Discussion Framework
- **Current State**: Summarize existing design and architecture
- **Pain Points**: Identify potential issues, bottlenecks, or concerns
- **Design Alternatives**: Propose different approaches with trade-offs
- **Best Practices**: Suggest relevant patterns, principles, or industry standards
- **Impact Analysis**: Discuss implications of potential changes

### 3. Interactive Exploration
- Ask clarifying questions about specific concerns
- Explore multiple solution paths
- Discuss pros/cons of different approaches
- Consider maintainability, scalability, and team context

## Focus Areas
- Architecture and structure
- Design patterns and principles
- Code organization and modularity
- Performance and scalability considerations
- Maintainability and extensibility
- Team workflow and development experience

## Guidelines
- **CRITICAL**: NO code modifications - discussion only
- Focus on the specific concerns raised
- Provide concrete examples and reasoning
- Consider both immediate and long-term implications
- Keep discussions practical and actionable

## Goal
Collaborative design exploration to improve code quality and address specific concerns through discussion and analysis.
