## How to Use

### Adding New Items
After retrospective, SM adds items:
```markdown
| AI-001 | [Description] | [Role] | YYYY-MM-DD | YYYY-MM-DD | [ ] Open |
```

### Updating Status
- [ ] Open → [x] In Progress → [x] Completed

### Verification
Before each Sprint, SM verifies:
- Are open items still relevant?
- Are in-progress items moving?
- Were completed items effective?
