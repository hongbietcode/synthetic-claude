# Improvement Backlog (IM's Log)

**Purpose**: Log process observations DURING work. Review at retrospective.

---

## How to Use

### During Project (Don't Stop Work)

When you notice friction:
1. Log it below with timestamp
2. Continue with your task
3. Report to IM: "Process observation: [brief]. Logged for retrospective."

### At Retrospective

IM reviews all entries, team discusses, picks 1-2 action items.
