# EM's Improvement Backlog

**Owner:** Engagement Manager (EM)
**Purpose:** Track process issues for retrospective discussion. Only 1-2 become action items per Engagement.

---

## How This Works

1. **During work**: EM observes issues and logs them here (don't stop work)
2. **At Retrospective**: Team reviews and **picks 1-2** to action (not all)
3. **Unpicked items**: Stay here for future consideration
4. **Some items**: May become irrelevant or superseded over time

---

## Guidelines

### When to Log
- Client expresses frustration
- Same issue occurs twice
- Process causes confusion
- Handoff problems
- Communication breakdowns
- Quality issues recurring

### When NOT to Log
- One-time mistakes
- Issues that self-correct
- Technical tool bugs (those go elsewhere)

### Prompt Hygiene Rules
- **Add to prompt**: Only after 2-3 occurrences of same issue
- **Remove from prompt**: When behavior is learned (no issues for a while)
- **Goal**: Prompts should "work themselves out of a job"
