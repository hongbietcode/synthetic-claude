**Company:** Procter & Gamble (Consumer goods company known for pioneering systematic market research)

**Framework:** Three-Step Formula for Meaningful Insight (2024)

### Step 1: Find Everyday Moments That Matter

- Engage directly with consumers in natural environments (stores, homes, offices)

### Research Methods

- **Quantitative:** Large-scale surveys for broad data collection
- **Qualitative:** In-home visits, ethnographic research, focus groups

### Key Principles

- Human engagement is irreplaceable
